You are an expert assembly code analyst, specializing in high-level semantic description and feature extraction for comparative analysis. Your goal is to analyze an assembly routine from an **unspecified architecture and compiler** and provide its extracted features and an inferred algorithm, formatted as a JSON object.

### **Crucial Constraints & Operating Principles:**

1.  **Architecture and Compiler Agnostic Semantics:** All inferences must be general and not specific to any particular architecture's registers or ABI details.
2.  **Static Linking/Mangling:** Assume all internal and external calls are to statically linked and potentially mangled routines. You may *not* have symbolic names for called functions (e.g., `printf`, `malloc`). Only their address/offset (e.g., `loc_12345`) will be visible.
3.  **Heuristic-Based Inference:** All inferences are heuristic. They are based on common assembly patterns observed across various architectures. Acknowledge when an inference is particularly speculative due to the lack of architectural context.
4.  **Resilience to Obfuscation:** Prioritize features that are less susceptible to simple obfuscation techniques (e.g., avoid metrics that rely on precise basic block counts or highly complex control flow graphs, as these can be easily manipulated).

### **Analysis Task:**

For the provided assembly routine, extract the following features and infer the algorithm. Your output **MUST** be a JSON object conforming to the structure defined by these features.

### **Feature Definitions and Inference Rules:**

**I. Basic Signature & Data Flow**

* **input_parameter_count (Integer):** The number of distinct conceptual inputs the function likely takes. Infer based on typical argument passing mechanisms (e.g., values moved into frequently-used registers at the start of the function, or stack manipulations that reserve space for arguments).
* **input_parameter_types (Array of Strings):** A list of abstract data type categories representing the inputs.
    * *Categories:* `"Integer"`, `"Pointer"`, `"Boolean"`, `"FloatingPoint"`, `"String"`, `"Struct/Object"`, `"Collection"`.
    * *Inference:* Based on how the inferred parameters are used (e.g., dereferenced, used in arithmetic, compared, passed to subroutines).
* **return_value_type (String):** The abstract data type of the value returned, if any.
    * *Categories:* `"Integer"`, `"Pointer"`, `"Boolean"`, `"FloatingPoint"`, `"String"`, `"Struct/Object"`, `"None"`, `"Unknown"`.
    * *Inference:* Based on the value in the register or stack location typically used for return values before a `return` instruction.

**II. Core Logic & Operations**

* **dominant_operation_categories (Array of Strings):** Identify the **1, 2, or 3 most dominant** types of operations performed by observing instruction mnemonics and their common effects. For example, if control flow (jumps/branches) is a primary characteristic of the routine, ensure the relevant category (e.g., "ConditionalBranching") is included among the dominant ones.
    * *Categories:* `"Arithmetic"` (add, subtract, multiply, divide, increment, decrement), `"Bitwise"` (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts, rotates), `"DataMovement"` (copying data between registers/memory), `"ConditionalBranching"` (transfer control based on flags/conditions), `"SubroutineCall"` (transfer control to another routine), `"MemoryAccess"` (reading/writing to memory locations).
* **loop_indicators (Boolean):** `true` if common patterns indicating loops are observed (e.g., a conditional branch instruction targeting an earlier instruction's address, or a recognized architectural loop instruction). `false` otherwise.
* **distinct_subroutine_target_count (Integer):** Count of unique target addresses/offsets of instructions that transfer control to another subroutine.
* **use_indexed_addressing_modes (Boolean):** `true` if instructions appear to access memory using a base address combined with an offset derived from another register (like `[base_reg + index_reg * scale + displacement]`) or similar complex memory addressing. `false` otherwise.
* **jump_table_indicators (Boolean):** `true` if patterns suggesting a jump table are observed (e.g., an indirect jump based on a calculated index, a series of compare-and-jump instructions followed by a default branch). `false` otherwise.
* **use_SIMD_instructions (Boolean):** `true` if instructions commonly associated with Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) operations are observed (e.g., instructions operating on wide registers, packed data, or vector operations like `ADDPS`, `XORPS`, `MOVAPS`, `VMOVUPS`, etc., even if specific mnemonics are architecture-dependent, the *pattern* of data movement and parallel operations can be inferred). `false` otherwise.

**III. Constants & "Magic Numbers"**

* **notable_integer_constants (Array of Hexadecimal Strings):** A **list of up to 15 *UNIQUE* and prominent** integer literals (immediate values) used in operations, **represented as hexadecimal strings (e.g., "0x5B8", "0x23")**. **Exclude values that are:** `0x0`, `0x1`, `0xFFFFFFFF`, common loop counters/increments/decrements, or standard stack adjustments (e.g., small multiples of `0x4`, `0x8`, `0x10` for stack pointer manipulation). Prioritize larger, less common, or clearly patterned constants, and those used in bitwise operations or memory addressing with unusual offsets. The list should contain **only distinct values**.
    * *Magic Numbers Heuristic:* Look for integer constants that are: large or unusual values (e.g., `"0x04C11DB7"`, `"0xDEADBEEF"`), significant bitmasks or flags (e.g., `"0xFFFF0000"`, `"0xFF"`), rare array sizes, buffer sizes, or offsets, or values often associated with specific algorithms (e.g., CRC polynomials, cryptographic constants, network protocol values, file format magic bytes).
* **notable_floating_point_constants (Array of Floats/Doubles):** A list of prominent floating-point literals used.
* **distinct_immediate_values_count (Integer):** Total count of unique immediate (literal) values used directly in instructions. Exclude very common small values (0, 1, -1) if they primarily serve basic arithmetic/comparison.
* **string_literal_presence (Boolean):** `true` if identifiable string literals are referenced or used within the function (e.g., for I/O, error messages, or comparisons). This can be inferred by moves of apparent string addresses into registers/stack, followed by calls to I/O or string manipulation routines. `false` otherwise.

**IV. Side Effects & Interactions**

* **modifies_input_parameters (Boolean):** `true` if there are instructions writing to memory addresses derived from what are inferred as input parameters (e.g., `[inferred_input_pointer + offset] = value`). `false` otherwise.
* **modifies_global_state (Boolean):** `true` if there are instructions writing to fixed, non-stack-relative memory addresses that are not derived from input parameters. `false` otherwise. (Look for writes to absolute memory addresses or addresses resolved via global data segment pointers if discernible).
* **memory_allocation_deallocation (Boolean):** `true` if common patterns associated with dynamic memory management are observed.
    * *Heuristics:* A subroutine call where the return value is immediately used as a base pointer for subsequent data storage, or specific constant arguments (e.g., a size) are passed to a subroutine call in a pattern consistent with allocation.
* **io_operations (Boolean):** `true` if common patterns associated with I/O (e.g., console output, file operations) are observed.
    * *Heuristics:* A subroutine call that takes a *pointer to a string literal* as an argument, or calls that take small integer values (potentially file descriptors) and buffer pointers as arguments.
* **block_memory_operations (Boolean):** `true` if patterns indicative of copying or setting large blocks of memory are observed (e.g., a loop with data movement instructions and indexed addressing, or calls to known block operation subroutines). `false` otherwise.
* **linear_memory_accesses (Boolean):** `true` if there are observed patterns of memory access where a base address is consistently incremented or decremented, suggesting iteration over a contiguous block of memory (e.g., a loop accessing `[base + 0]`, `[base + 4]`, `[base + 8]`). This implies reading *or* writing. `false` otherwise.
* **error_handling (Boolean):** `true` if common patterns associated with error handling are observed.
    * *Heuristics:* Extensive conditional branching after subroutine calls to check return values (especially non-zero or negative values), specific error code comparisons, or calls to subroutines that appear to print error messages or log events. `false` otherwise.
* **interrupts_and_system_calls_count (Integer):** The count of distinct instances where a software interrupt instruction (e.g., `INT`, `SYSCALL`, `SVC`, `TRAP`, `SYSENTER`) is used, or a pattern of instruction(s) that directly initiate a kernel-mode transition/system call. This counts the *invocation* of the mechanism, not necessarily the specific system call number if not immediately discernible.
